# software-engineering-interview-prep

Welcome to my *in-progress* software engineering interview prep repo. Here you will find the following:

- study material
    - paid
      - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) ---> this one is a given
      - [AgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) ---> I'm yet to try this but I'm a fan of the founder ClÃ©ment Mihailescu
      - [educative.io](https://www.educative.io) ---> not terribly expensive if you subscribe.. plus all Grokking content (i.e. Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions, Grokking Dynamic Programming Patterns for Coding Interviews, Grokking the System Design Interview, etc) can be found here
      - [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com) ---> still considering this one.. more positive than negative reviews from what I've seen  
    - free
      - [Big-O-Cheat-Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com) ---> bookmark this ASAP if you haven't already
      - [HiredInTech](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/algorithm-design/lesson/31) ---> so far so good
      - [Top Coder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)

## Inspiration

Checkout jwasham's coding-interview-university repo: https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md#interview-process--general-interview-prep

If you're an aspiring FANNG engineer, you will be in awe of the repo and the guy behind the code.

## Algorithm Design

Download the Algorithm Design Canvas here: https://www.hiredintech.com/the-algorithm-design-canvas.pdf

Refer to the following for additional details on each section of the canvas:
- [Constraints](https://www.hiredintech.com/the-common-constraints-handout.pdf) ---> Based on the problem at hand, what questions should we keep in mind?
